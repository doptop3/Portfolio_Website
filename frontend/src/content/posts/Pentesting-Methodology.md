## Comprehensive Penetration Testing Guide   
Before any testing begins, it's helpful to establish clear rules of engagement through pre-engagement activities. Consider defining the scope, objectives, timeline, and legal boundaries, documenting everything in a formal agreement to protect both parties. Resources like [PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)](http://www.pentest-standard.org/) and the [OWASP Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/) can provide useful frameworks for structuring this phase.

Reconnaissance forms the foundation of many penetration tests, involving tools that help with everything from identifying devices on a network to discovering open ports on targeted servers. Common tools include [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) for network discovery and security auditing, [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) for network protocol analysis, [Masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan) as a fast port scanner, and [Rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) as a modern alternative. For automated reconnaissance workflows, [AutoRecon](https://github.com/AutoRecon/AutoRecon) offers multi-threaded network reconnaissance, while [nmapAutomator](https://github.com/21y4d/nmapAutomator) and [Reconnoitre](https://github.com/codingo/Reconnoitre) provide additional automation capabilities.

Attacking wireless network interface cards (WNIC) takes advantage of omnidirectional radio-waves transmitted through [QAM](https://blog.minicircuits.com/a-primer-on-quadrature-amplitude-modulation-qam/) and [OFDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing) protocols. [Aircrack-ng](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/aircrack-ng), an injector and frame replay tool, performs cryptoanalysis to recover WEP and WPA/WPA2-Pre-Shared Key (PSK) keys using various techniques. Additional wireless tools include [Wifite](https://github.com/derv82/wifite2) for automated wireless attacks, [Kismet](https://www.kismetwireless.net/) as a wireless network detector and sniffer, and [Fern WiFi Cracker](https://github.com/savio-code/fern-wifi-cracker) providing a GUI-based approach to wireless security auditing.

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) involves gathering publicly available information about targets through tools like [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) for email, subdomain, and name harvesting, [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) as a search engine for Internet-connected devices, [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/) for data mining and intelligence gathering, [Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng) as a web reconnaissance framework, [SpiderFoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot) for automated OSINT collection, and [FOCA](https://github.com/ElevenPaths/FOCA) for metadata analysis.

When it comes to HTTP there's many paths that can be taken, [pentestbook](https://pentestbook.six2dez.com/enumeration/web) is a link often used to aid discovery. Directory and content discovery through crawl and fuzz tools helps uncover hidden files, directories, and endpoints. [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) serves as a fast web fuzzer that many find effective, while [Gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) provides directory, file, and DNS busting capabilities. [Dirbuster](https://github.com/KajanM/DirBuster) offers multi-threaded directory brute-forcing, [Feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) enables fast recursive content discovery, and [wfuzz](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz) acts as a comprehensive web application fuzzer. These tools work well when paired with quality wordlists from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists), which provides collections of multiple list types for security assessments, and [FuzzDB](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb) containing attack patterns and predictable resource locations.

Web crawling and spidering can utilize tools like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) as an integrated platform for web application security testing, [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) as a web application security scanner, [Hakrawler](https://github.com/hakluke/hakrawler) as a fast web crawler, [Katana](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana) as a next-generation crawling framework, and [GoSpider](https://github.com/jaeles-project/gospider) for fast web spidering.

Post-exploitation activities often begin with establishing file transfer capabilities. Now that it's setup, the [http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) can share files through [socketserver.TCPserver](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html#socketserver.TCPServer) as a localhost:80. I'll be sharing my priv esc tools which for this example i'll use [linpeas](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) with [linenum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum) as a backup. File transfer methods include running Python's built-in HTTP server using `python3 -m http.server 80`, [Updog](https://github.com/sc0tfree/updog) as an improved Python HTTP server with upload capability, [Impacket's smbserver](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) for quick SMB servers, [Certutil](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil) as a Windows built-in file download utility, and various [PowerShell download cradles](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/bb48307ffa663256e239) for alternative download methods.

A typical penetration test might follow with pre-engagement for scoping, contracts, and rules of engagement, moving to reconnaissance for passive and active information gathering, progressing to enumeration searching discovered services and systems, finding vulnerabilies searching databases for potential weaknesses, exploitation to gain initial access, expanding through post-exploitation with privilege escalation, lateral movement, and persistence, and concluding with reporting the entire process. Obtain proper authorization before testing any systems you don't own, unauthorized access hold legal consequences regardless of intent or methodology used.
